# Lame Namer 9000
Lame Namer 9000 is a tiny project name generator written in Python utilizing [Vaibhav Singh](https://github.com/vaibhavsingh97)'s RandomWords module.
I'm by no means a professional programmer, as I wrote this to make naming my Ableton Live projects easier.

# Usage
To run Lame Namer 9000, you'll need Vaibhav Singh's RandomWords module, which can be installed with `pip`.
Simply run `python3 LameNamer.py` and it will generate an underscored name with a day number tacked on the front.
