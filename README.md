# Lame Namer 9000
Lame Namer 9000 is a tiny project name generator written in Python utilizing [Vaibhav Singh](https://github.com/vaibhavsingh97)'s Random-Word module.
I'm by no means a professional programmer, as I wrote this to make naming my music projects easier. Inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/V7gL2GQIPU4?t=91).

# Usage
To run Lame Namer 9000, you'll need Vaibhav Singh's Random-Word module, which can be installed with `pip`.
Simply run `LameNamer.py` in Python 3 or later and it will generate a name with a day number prepended to it (for organization purposes).
